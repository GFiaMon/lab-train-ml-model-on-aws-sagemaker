# LAB | Train a Machine Learning Model in AWS SageMaker 

### Instructions

1. Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to **SageMaker**.

2. Inside SageMaker Studio:
   - Choose **File → New → Notebook**.
   - Select a small CPU kernel (e.g., Python 3).

3. Prepare your ML script:
   - You may reuse a previous ML model or create a new simple script.
   - Run code to train a model and make predictions.

4. When finished:
   - Go to **Kernel → Shut Down** to stop the notebook’s backing instance.
   - Make sure to stop the Notebook instance or delete to avoid incurring costs.
   - This ensures no further billing for infrastructure occurs.

### Deliverable  
- Screenshot of the Instance on AWS SageMaker.  
- Screenshot of the notebook with the output of the prediction printed.  

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
